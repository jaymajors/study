## Counting the number of characters

Create a program that prompts for an input string and displays output that shows the input string and the number of characters the string contains.

### Constraints
- Be sure the output contains the original string.
- Use a single output statement to construct the output.
- Use a built-in function of the programming language to determine the length of the string.

### Challenges
If the user enters nothing, state that the user must enter something into the program.

Implement this program using a graphical user interface and update the character counter every time a key is pressed. If your language doesnâ€™t have a particularly friendly GUI library, try doing this exercise with HTML and JavaScript instead.
