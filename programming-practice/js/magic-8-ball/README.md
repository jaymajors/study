## Magic Eight Ball

Arrays are great for storing possible responses from a program. If you combine that with a random number generator, you can pick a random entry from this list, which works great for games.

Create a Magic 8 Ball game that prompts for a question and then displays either “Yes,” “No,” “Maybe,” or “Ask again later.”

**Example Output**

What's your question? Will I be rich and famous?

Ask again later.

**Constraint**

The value should be chosen randomly using a pseudo random number generator. Store the possible choices in a list and select one at random.

Challenges

- Implement this as a GUI application.

- If available, use native device libraries to allow you to “shake” the 8 ball.
