## Troubleshooting car issues

An expert system is a type of artificial intelligence program that uses a knowledge base and a set of rules to perform a task that a human expert might do. Many websites are available that will help you self-diagnose a medical issue by answering a series of questions. And many hardware and software companies offer online troubleshooting tools to help people solve simple technical issues before calling a human.

Create a program that walks the user through troubleshooting issues with a car. Use the following decision tree to build the system:

**Example Output**
​
Is the car silent when you turn the key? y
​
Are the battery terminals corroded? n
​
The battery cables may be damaged.
​
Replace cables and try again.

**Constraint**

- Ask only questions that are relevant to the situation and to the previous answers. Don’t ask for all inputs at once.

**Challenge**

- Investigate rules engines and inference engines. These are powerful ways to solve complex problems that are based on rules and facts. Identify a rules engine for your programming language and use it to solve this problem.
